# About The Project
Prowl is an open-source, **MIT-licensed** game engine developed in **pure C# in .NET 8**, (which surprisingly has **no runtime fees** believe it or not!). It aims to provide a seamless transition for developers familiar with Unity by maintaining a similar API while also following KISS and staying as small and customizable as possible. This engine is intended to be customized to your needs, everything is written to be a "Minimal" Production-Ready Implementation. Ideally, there will be plenty of Modules/Packages to expand on functionality for those who don't want (or are unable) to expand the base engine.

**Note:** The Engine is very young and far from production-ready, being developed mainly by a single developer in his spare time. **And has only been tested and compiled for Windows!**
