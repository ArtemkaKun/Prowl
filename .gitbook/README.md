  * The Prowl Engine requires Visual Studio 2022 version 17.8.0 or later to support .NET 8.
  * You can download Visual Studio 2022 from the official Microsoft website: [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* .NET 8 SDK
  * You can download the .NET 8 SDK from the official Microsoft website: [SDK Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

#### Installation

1.  Clone the Prowl Engine repository from GitHub:

    ```

    Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file from the GitHub page: [Prowl Engine GitHub Repository](https://github.com/michaelsakharov/Prowl)
2. Open the cloned or downloaded repository in Visual Studio 2022:
